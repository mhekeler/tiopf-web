Key points to make:

---

Unit testing of code that interacts with singletons:

DUnit 2 may report leaks

Just access the singleton

Drop and re-create the singleton

Isolate access to the singleton via a virtual method

Use traverse up the object graph with Parent.Parent

Delay accessing the singleton resource as long as possible

Testing classes with private methods (make them protected)
